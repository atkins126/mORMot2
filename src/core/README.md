# mORMot Core Units

## Folder Content

This folder hosts the Core Units of the *mORMot* Open Source framework, version 2.

## Core Units

With "Core Units", we mean units implementing shared basic functionality of our framework:

- Uncoupled reusable bricks to process files, text, JSON, compression, encryption, network, RTTI, potentially with optimized asm;
- Other higher level features, like ORM, SOA or database access are built on top of those bricks, and are located in the parent folder;
- Cross-Platform and Cross-Compiler: ensure the same code would compile on both FPC and Delphi, on any support platform, regardless the RTL, Operating System, or CPU.

## Units Presentation

### mormot.core.base

Basic types and reusable stand-alone functions shared by all framework units
- Framework Version and Information
- Common Types Used for Compatibility Between Compilers and CPU
- Numbers (floats and integers) Low-level Definitions
- integer Arrays Manipulation
- `ObjArray` `PtrArray` `InterfaceArray` Wrapper Functions
- Low-level Types Mapping Binary or Bits Structures
- Buffers (e.g. Hashing and SynLZ compression) Raw Functions
- Date / Time Processing
- Efficient `Variant` Values Conversion
- Sorting/Comparison Functions
- Some Convenient `TStream` descendants and File access functions
- Faster Alternative to RTL Standard Functions
- Raw Shared Constants / Types Definitions

Aim of those types and functions is to be cross-platform and cross-compiler, without any dependency but the main FPC/Delphi RTL. It also detects the kind of Intel/AMD it runs on, to adapt to the fastest asm version available. It is the main unit where x86_64 or i386 asm stubs are included.

### mormot.core.os

Cross-platform functions shared by all framework units
- Gather Operating System Information
- Operating System Specific Types (e.g. `TWinRegistry`)
- Unicode, Time, File, Console, Library process
- Per Class Properties O(1) Lookup via `vmtAutoTable` Slot (e.g. for RTTI cache)
- `TSynLocker`/`TSynLocked` and Low-Level Threading Features
- Unix Daemon and Windows Service Support

Aim of this unit is to centralize most used OS-specific API calls, like a `SysUtils` unit on steroids, to avoid `$ifdef/$endif` in "uses" clauses.

In practice, no "Windows", nor "Linux/Unix" reference should be needed in regular units, once `mormot.core.os` is included. :)

### mormot.core.unicode

- UTF-8 Efficient Encoding / Decoding
- UTF-8 / UTF-16 / Ansi Conversion Classes

### mormot.core.rtti

Cross-Compiler RTTI Definitions shared by all framework units

- RTTI Value Types used for JSON Parsing
- RTTI-based Registration for Custom JSON Parsing
- Redirect Most Used FPC RTL Functions to Optimized x86_64 Assembly

Purpose of this unit is to avoid any direct use of `TypInfo.pas` RTL unit, which is not exactly compatible between compilers, and lacks of direct RTTI access with no memory allocation. We define pointers to RTTI record/object to access `TypeInfo()` via a set of explicit methods. Here fake record/objects are just wrappers around pointers defined in Delphi/FPC RTL's `TypInfo.pas` with the magic of inlining. We redefined all RTTI definitions as `TRtti*` types to avoid confusion with type names as published by the `TypInfo` unit.

At higher level, the new `TRttiCustom` class is the main cached entry of our customizable RTTI,accessible from the global `Rtti.*` methods. It is enhanced in the `mormot.core.json` unit to support JSON.
